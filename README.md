# Urban Routes - QA Testing Project

## üöÄ Project Overview

**Urban Routes** is a web application for planning routes, estimating travel times, and calculating costs for different transportation methods.

This project showcases the complete manual QA testing process for the application, from requirement analysis to test case execution.

## üõ†Ô∏è My Role & Contributions

As the **QA Engineer** for this project, I was responsible for ensuring the application's quality and functionality. My key contributions included:

* **Designing and developing comprehensive test cases** using black-box testing techniques.
* **Validating data input** across all web application forms to ensure data integrity.
* **Analyzing network traffic** with Chrome DevTools to inspect HTTP responses and test new features.
* **Utilizing JIRA and Google Workspace** for effective test case management and documentation.

## üß™ Testing Approach & Techniques

A **functional system testing** approach was used to verify the application against its requirements.

* **Test cases** were developed using black-box methods, focusing on **equivalence partitioning** and **boundary value analysis**.
* Both **positive and negative test scenarios** were executed to ensure robust application behavior.
